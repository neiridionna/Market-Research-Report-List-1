<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CRT Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Random-Scan displays</li><li>Raster-scan displays</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CRT monitor market is divided into two primary types: random-scan and raster-scan displays. Random-scan displays, also known as vector monitors, draw images line by line directly on the screen, making them ideal for graphics and CAD applications due to their high precision and sharpness. In contrast, raster-scan displays use a grid of pixels to create images by scanning each row of pixels sequentially, which is suitable for general-purpose applications like gaming and video, providing smoother images and better color representation.</p></p>
