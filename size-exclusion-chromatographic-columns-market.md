<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Size Exclusion Chromatographic Columns Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gel Permeation Chromatography</li><li>Gel Filtration Chromatography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) columns are categorized primarily into Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC) and Gel Filtration Chromatography (GFC). GPC is used for separating polymers and small molecules based on size in organic solvents, focusing on solute molecular weight. In contrast, GFC is applied in biological and biochemical contexts to separate biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in aqueous buffers. Both techniques utilize porous gels to facilitate the separation process by allowing smaller molecules to enter the pores while larger molecules elude quickly.</p></p>
