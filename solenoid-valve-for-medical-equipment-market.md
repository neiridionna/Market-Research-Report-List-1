<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solenoid Valve for Medical Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Acting</li><li>Pilot Operated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solenoid valves in the medical equipment market are categorized into two main types: direct acting and pilot operated. Direct acting solenoid valves utilize a magnetic field to directly control the valve's movement, making them suitable for applications requiring quick response and low flow rates. Pilot operated solenoid valves, on the other hand, use a smaller pilot orifice to control a larger flow, offering higher pressure capabilities and reduced power consumption. Both types are essential for precise fluid control in medical devices.</p></p>
